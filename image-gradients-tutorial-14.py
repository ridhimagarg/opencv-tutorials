Application of gardients in images 

Gradients here itself means partial derivatives.
Gradients are useful in detecting the edges based on color 
gradients.

Derivative of a matrix is calculated by an operator called Laplacian.

For derivatives, we have to cal. two derivatives, Sobal derivatives - one is horizontal, vertical.

This is some mathematical details, let's go to implementation.
